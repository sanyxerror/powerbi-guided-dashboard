### Reflection
Since this was a fully guided project (and my first time using PowerBI) i just followed the recording closely and didnt put too much of my own insights into the dashboard, however from the next project i wanna make sure to include my own insights and aesthetic touch to my dashboards!!
I am planning to find my own dataset and create a board out of it but i probably need more practice before thatðŸ˜³, however i think doing this project prepared me for it and i am quite confident in my abilities now.
